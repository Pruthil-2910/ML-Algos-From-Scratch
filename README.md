## 🧠 **Why this repo?**
Because **importing is easy**, but **building teaches what’s under the hood**.  
In this digital temple 🛕, I’m coding classic ML algorithms *from scratch* – no scikit-learn, no shortcuts – just:
- Pure Python 🐍
- Math scribbled on paper ✏️
- And a sprinkle of stubborn curiosity 🌱

## 📦 **What’s inside?**
| 📊 Algorithm                | ⚙️ Status        | 📄 Details                    |
|---------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Linear Regression         | ✅ Done         | Fit a line & predict numbers |
| Logistic Regression      | 🔧 Coming soon | Classify 0/1 with sigmoid    |
| Decision Trees           | 🔧 Coming soon | Split & conquer data        |
| k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)| 🔧 Coming soon | Learn from your neighbors   |
| k-Means Clustering       | 🔧 Coming soon | Find hidden patterns        |
| ...                      | 🧪 Planned      | More to come!               |

## ⚡ **Philosophy**
> *"Muscles don’t grow by watching; they grow by lifting weights."* 🏋️‍♂️  
Same with ML: **understanding grows by building, failing, and fixing**.

I’m not writing perfect code.  
I’m writing **code that learns** – and helps *me* learn.

## 🧰 **How to run**
> Clone it, explore, and run any algorithm:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pruhtil_2910/ml-algorithms-from-scratch.git
cd ml-algorithms-from-scratch
python linear_regression/linear_regression.py
